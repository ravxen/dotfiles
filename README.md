# My dotfiles
Welcome to my dotfiles page! I'm new to the whole ricing, editing configs and creating scripts, so it will take some time, until this page looks nice.

Current colorscheme: Gruvbox Dark

To-Do before script:
- Replace waybar with ags
- Improve consistency

## 
Script is not available as of now.

You can git clone the repository and install it manually. 
Files are always the most signifanct and polished version.

## Applications
Shell: zsh + oh-my-zsh

Terminal: kitty

Window Manager: hyprland

Status Bar: waybar

Application Launcher: fuzzel

File Manager: yazi

Notification Center: swaync

Audio: pipewire, wireplumber + pulsemixer

Network Manager: networkmanager

Bluetooth: bluez + bluetui

## Troubleshooting
